            <h1>Introducing my Blog<span>15th July, 2012</span></h1>
            <p>
                Just thought I'd create a quick post to introduce my blog to
                the world properly. Now I have a place where I can post
                self-absorbed ramblings on the internet in a way that suits me
                best! Hooray!
            </p><p>
                I created a pretty terrible system for creating and publishing
                posts for this blog. Creating a new post is as simple as typing
                <code>./post "Title of Post"</code> in my terminal. Then, I can
                edit the post before using <code>./publish</code> to publish
                the blog post to the github-hosted blog, and annoy everyone
                on twitter about it.
            </p><p>
                I have tried to keep everything as simple as possible. Hence the
                simple design and total lack of comments. If you want to throw
                insults at me in response to one of my blog posts, I guess you
                could just shout at me on twitter or something.
            </p><p>
                This blog is supposed to be a place for me to throw my thoughts,
                which are a scarce resource these days. I may write a bit more
                about how this blog works, or doesn't work, in a later blog post.
                For now, though, I don't really care much.
            </p><p>
                The links at the bottom of blog posts serve as sufficient navigation
                for this harberdash scratching exhibition. Or at least I think so
                anyways.
            </p><p>
                That's all for now! I'll probably forget about this thing soon enough.
