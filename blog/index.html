            <h1>dAmn Packet Syntax</h1>
            <p>
                <a href="http://deviantart.com">deviantART</a>'s chat (dAmn)
                use a text-based protocol. The packets in this protocol follow
                a particular format. As such, it seemed appropriate for someone
                to define the grammar used by dAmn packets. No grammar is openly
                provided by deviantART, but the protocol is largely documented
                by the #<a href="http://botlab.deviantart.com">Botdom</a> group,
                which is a group of third-party developers, of which I am a member.
                The documentation we have on the protocol can be found
                <a href="http://botdom.com/documentation/dAmn">on our wiki</a>.
            </p><p>
                Enough rambling. Below you can see the grammar I have written.
            </p>
            <pre class="bnf"><code><span class="symbol">key</span> <span class="assign"><span class="op">::</span>=</span> <span class="desc">&lt;any character excluding argument_separator, whitespace, and null&gt;</span>*

            <p>
                While the grammar above defines the syntax of a dAmn packet
                sufficiently, it doesn't reveal too much about how the protocol
                actually works. The body of the packet can and often does
                contain one or more sub-packets. These can be treated the
                same way as normal packets if parsers handle packets according
                to the grammar above. But there are some things to consider
                about packets, sub-packets, and how they differ.
            </p><p>
                All packets that are not sub-packets will always at least
                have a command. Sub-packets do not always have commands. As
                such, the definition of the <code>packet</code> symbol above would
                work best as a definition for a sub-packet.
            </p><p>
                Whatever the packet looks like, if it has a body, the packet
                header (command line and arguments) and body are separated
                with two newline characters <code>(\n\n)</code>. Below is an
                attempt at accounting for the oddities in the packet syntax.
            </p>
            <pre class="bnf"><code><span class="symbol">sub_packet</span> <span class="assign"><span class="op">::</span>=</span> <span class="group">( <span class="optional">[ <span class="symbol">cmdline</span> ]</span> <span class="symbol">argument</span>+ <span class="op">|</span> <span class="symbol">cmdline</span> )</span> <span class="optional">[ <span class="string">"\n"</span> <span class="symbol">body</span> ]</span>
<span class="symbol">packet</span> <span class="assign"><span class="op">::</span>=</span> <span class="symbol">cmdline argument</span>* <span class="string">"\n"</span> <span class="optional">[ <!--<span class="symbol">sup_packet</span> <span class="op">|</span> --><span class="symbol">body</span> ]</span> <span class="string">"\0"</span></code></pre>
            <p>
                Even though I haven't defined it in the stuff above, the
                sub-packet body can be another sub-packet. And so on and so
                forth. That should be pretty obvious, though.
            </p>
            <h1>Tablumps</h1>
            <p>
                When sending messages across deviantART's chatrooms, users can send
                various HTML elements, as well as special tags specific to the chat
                server. When sending these elements in a message, the chat server
                will parse these elements out of the message, and if they are valid,
                they will be replaced with a formatted string representing the
                element in plain text.
            </p><p>
                We refer to these formatted strings as "tablumps", as they are
                typically a set of arguments separated by tab characters
                <code>(\t)</code>. The syntax for tablumps is pretty simple in
                comparison to the packet syntax, and is sufficiently described
                by the grammar below.
            </p>
            <pre class="bnf"><code><span class="symbol">separator</span> <span class="assign"><span class="op">::</span>=</span> <span class="string">"\t"</span>
<span class="symbol">argument</span> <span class="assign"><span class="op">::</span>=</span> <span class="desc">&lt;([^&\t])&gt;</span>* <span class="symbol">separator</span>
<span class="symbol">tablump</span> <span class="assign"><span class="op">::</span>=</span> <span class="string">"&"</span> <span class="symbol">argument</span> <span class="group">( <span class="symbol">argument</span> )</span>* <span class="optional">[ <span class="string">"&"</span> <span class="symbol">separator</span> ]</span></code></pre>
            <p>
                It should be noted that most tablumps have a fixed number of arguments.
                Tablumps of variable length appear to be the only tablumps that end with
                <code>&\t</code>. This can be viewed as an empty tablump, as it begins
                with <code>&</code>, ends with <code>\t</code>, but has no content. This
                would be fitting with the rest of the tablumps, but when considered part
                of the tablump, it could be thought to denote the tablump as being self-closing.
            </p><p>
                Evidence to support that the ending <code>&\t</code> is actually
                a separate tablump would be the fact that some of the HTML elements
                mapped to tablumps do not close themselves, and usually have an
                accompanying tablump that closes the element. For instance, the
                tablump for a hyperlink starts with <code>&a\t</code>, but the
                closing tab is formatted as a separate tablump, <code>&/a\t</code>.
            </p><p>
                Note that most tablump parsers treat a the closing <code>&\t</code>
                as part of the same tablump, rather than a separate tablump, partly
                because it is useful when determining the end of variable length
                tablumps.
